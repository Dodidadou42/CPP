The C++ Piscine is an intensive learning experience designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of C++ programming over a series of projects spread across a month. The curriculum includes topics such as object-oriented programming, memory management, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL). Students implement various small programs to get hands-on experience with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, and operator overloading. The course culminates in a series of challenging exercises that require combining these elements to build more complex systems, reinforcing the principles of robust software design and modular coding in C++.


Technologies used: C++, Makefile, STL.

Key skills developed: Object-oriented design, memory management, template programming, use of comprehensive C++ features and STL components.
